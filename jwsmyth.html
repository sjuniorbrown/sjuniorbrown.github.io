          <p>I was on the team that developed this site. This was one of the first sites I developed when I entered my first role at EBCD. This is an e-commerce site and was developed on the opencart platform. I was taught aboout MVC, Relational databases,
            API's, OAUTH, SQL and PHP. I needed to learn these skill in order to be a useful developer as this is the choosen platform that the company uses to develop ecommerce sites.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I was tasked with building the sites hompage, contact page and information pages. To do this I had to build the site using MVC and I had to use a lot of PHP to make sure that all the modules which were being developed by the other members of
            my team would display in the correct places.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This site took 2 months to develop. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and AJAX.</p>
