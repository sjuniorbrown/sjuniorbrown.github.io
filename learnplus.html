      <p>Web Developer at (1 year 2 months) Building an online learning platform to help users learn whatever it is they wish to learn. Similar to Lynda.com but content is crowd sourced.</p>
<p>I worked on very basic front-end development using HTML, CSS, Javascript. I was given designs by other members on my team and I was tasked with building them out. I was responsible for developing and delivering the sites homepage, dashboards and video pages. I was also responsible for adding functionality to the sites many buttons and contact forms. I was also responsible for the sites overall responsivness</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also learned how to use Photoshop during my time working on this project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project took over 9 months to complete. The technologies I used were HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a little bit of PHP.</p></div>
