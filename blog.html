                <h3>Day 2| Styling the site </h3>
                <p>So today I decided to style the site. I added in some basic stles to a container I created. I gave it a <code> max-width</code> of 960px so that when I go to make the site responsive, I can work with a very familiar boxed layout.</p>
                <p>Also I decided to fix the nav menu straight away because the one thing that annoys the crap outta me is a poorly done nav menu. So I think I'm gonna go ahead and just finish it off with some nice styling and not have to worry about it
                    in the future.</p>
                <p>Damn! it's getting late now, so I'm gonna stop here for now. <br> I have work in the morning and I really don't want to get too sucked into this because once I start, I really never will stop. I love making websites beautiful and perfect
                    but I really also enjoy being able to wake up with a lot of energy, and go for a run on the beach. <br> I might actually throw a really nice picture up here tomorrow and maybe move this blog into it's own page. just to make it wasier
                    once I have like 180 blog posts up</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways I'm off for the day see you guys tomorrow! (or Saturday depending if my friends and I are going to the cinema :D)</p>

                    <h3>Day 3| Moving the blog and further styling </h3>
                    <p>
                        So today in work I decided to take 10 minuites to just move the blog over and style the site further. Gonna do that now and get back to coding in <u>PHP</u>.... I <strong>hate</strong> working with PHP it's clunky, overhyped and
                        in my opinion so slow. Why can't we all just live in a world of Python!

              <p>
                I've managed to squeeze in some time today and I plan on doing a lot with it!
              </p>
              <p>
                Right so over the weekend I said that I would implement a 3 X 3 portfolio gallery on the hompage and that's what I'm gonna do today

                <h3>Day 7| Image Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                  I've basically added a 3X3 portfolio to the site but I'm having some issues with positioning, so tomorrow I'll get cracking on that. Then I'll have the easter break to basically clean up my HTML, CSS and then introduce some JavaScript into the mix.<br /> Just going to commit these changes and edit once I get home (well perfect and debug!)
