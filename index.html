        <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
        <p>Basically what I attempt to do is make a 180 websites in 180 days! By doing this I hope to not only improve myself as a web developer by designing sites that gradually increase in complexity by iterating on the original conception. (This is the original conception!)</p>

        <h3>Day 2| Styling the stte </h3>
        <p>So today I decided to style the site. I added in some basic stles to a container I created. I gave it a <code> max-width</code> of 960px so that when I go to make the site responsive, I can work with a very familiar boxed layout.</p>
        <p>Also I decided to fix the nav menu straight away because the one thing that annoys the crap outta me is a poorly done nav menu. So I think I'm gonna go ahead and just finish it off with some nice styling and not have to worry about it in the future.</p>
        <p>Damn! it's getting late now, so I'm gonna stop here for now. <br> I have work in the morning and I really don't want to get too sucked into this because once I start, I really never will stop. I love making websites beautiful and perfect but I really also enjoy being able to wake up with a lot of energy, and go for a run on the beach. <br> I might actually throw a really nice picture up here tomorrow and maybe move this blog into it's own page. just to make it wasier once I have like 180 blog posts up</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyways I'm off for the day see you guys tomorrow! (or Saturday depending if my friends and I are going to the cinema :D)</p>
